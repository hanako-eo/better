# better

A "core" safety implementation for V

The goal of better is to allow writing more safety and efficiency programme with V

**ACTUALLY IN WIP**

```bash
v install --git https://github.com/hanako-eo/better
```

With better you get access to:
 - memory module (unsafe by default)
 - collections (Vec, Slice, Iterator)
 - Maybe & Result (same as Option & Result builtin the language but with methods)
